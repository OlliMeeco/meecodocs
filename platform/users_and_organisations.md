# Users and Organisations

Within Meeco’s SVX Platform, different roles have been developed for different purposes. These roles have been associated with a number of individual users and organisations. Understanding the difference between these users and organisations is important, as it will help you to understand the responsibilities of each entity and how to identify the right role for the entities in your use cases.

Firstly, it is worth noting that regardless of whether you are using Meeco’s APIs, or if you are interacting via our Enterprise Portal, the different users and organisations are consistent across both.

## Role in the Ecosystem

Please note that the term ‘Organisation’ is occasionally used throughout our documentation as a cover-all term for any enterprise, company, group, or association. When utilising our platform, ‘Organisation’ refers to a specific role played by an enterprise, company, group, or association undertaking actions within a Tenancy.

| Ecosystem Participant   | Role  | 
|-------------|--------|
| Tenancy       | A Tenancy is operated by an enterprise/company, referred to as a Tenant and consists of Organisations, and by extension, Organisation End-users (customers). |
| Tenant       | A Tenant is operated by Tenant Administrators and is responsible for the governance of its Tenancy participants. | 
| Tenant Administrator | An individual (user) who has administrator access and permissions within a Tenant. A Tenant Administrator is responsible for the actions that take place within their Tenant, including the onboarding, management and governance of Organisations. | 
| Organisation     | An organisation participating in the ecosystem will typically take the role of a credential Issuer, Verifier, or both. The Tenant onboards organisations and sets the rights associated with an organisation (i.e.. allowing it to issue or verify credentials) and its administrators. | 
| Organisation Administrator | An individual (user) who has administrator access and permissions within an organisation. An Organisation Administrator is responsible for the actions that take place within their Organisation, including issuing and/or verifying credentials and management of their lifecycle. |
| End User | End users are invited to a Tenancy and benefit from services offered by Issuers and Verifiers.  |
